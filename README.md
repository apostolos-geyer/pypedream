# Pypelite

A lightweight library for declarative workflows in Python.

### Why?

Because sometimes people are still iterating on ideas and don't want docker, and airflow, 
and other scaling and orchestration tools. Sometimes you just want to iterate on an idea 
and still have a way to cobble together a "pipeline".

Or, perhaps your computer is powerful enough / your workload is relaxed enough that you don't
need all of this extra tooling and cloud and distributed whatever the hell, but you still want
reproducability and structured logging and such. 

This is the library for that... or it will be.
