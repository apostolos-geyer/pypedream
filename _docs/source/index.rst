pypedream
====================================
A lightweight Python library for building workflows with modularity and observability.

This library is under development and not ready for use. Maybe it never will be. 
Maybe one day someone will stumble on this documentation and wonder what might have been. 
It could be me, it could be you, it could be our children, or the aliens that
come to destroy us. "What's the point of this?" they'll ask. "Why did they bother?"

At key moments in history, people have asked themselves the same question. Why build the pyramids?
Why build the Great Wall of China? Why build the Large Hadron Collider?

The answer is in the title of an Afroman song.
