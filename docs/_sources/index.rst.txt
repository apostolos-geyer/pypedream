pypedream :D
====================================
A lightweight Python library for building workflows with modularity and observability.

This library is under development and not ready for use. However, it aims to be useful for:

- Developers iterating quickly on a pipeline without needing Airflow, Dagster, or similar platforms.
- Those requiring modularity, version control, and robustness in their data processing beyond basic scripts.
- Users whose pipelines can run on local hardware and do not need constant orchestration.

Or maybe it will never be anything. Maybe one day someone will stumble on this documentation and wonder
what might have been. It could be me, it could be you, it could be our children, or the aliens that
come to destroy us. "What's the point of this?" they'll ask. "Why did they bother?"

At key moments in history, people have asked themselves the same question. Why build the pyramids?
Why build the Great Wall of China? Why build the Large Hadron Collider?

The answer is in the title of an Afroman song.
